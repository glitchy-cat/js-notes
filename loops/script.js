console.log('Lets learn about loops!');


/* This is a basic for loop */
for(let rep = 1;rep <= 10; rep ++) {
    console.log(`Lifting weights repetition ${rep}`)
};

/*Its is structured like this:

for()
let rep = 1 (Where is the loop beginning?) ** At 1 in this case
rep <= 10 (Where will it stop) ** When rep is = or greater than 10
rep ++ (How will it get there?) ** By adding 1 to rep each time with ++ 

The loop keeps running while the condition is TRUE*/
